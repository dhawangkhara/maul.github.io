Description: File manager with an ncurses frontend written in Python
 Ranger is a free console file manager that gives you greater flexibility and a
 good overview of your files without having to leave your *nix console. It
 visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory hierarchy on
 one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right so you know
 where you'll be going.
 .
 The default keys are similar to those of Vim, Emacs and Midnight Commander,
 though Ranger is easily controllable with just the arrow keys or the mouse.
 .
 The program is written in Python and uses curses for the text-based user
 interface.
